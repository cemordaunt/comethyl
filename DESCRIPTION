Description: Comethyl builds upon the WGCNA package to identify and interpret modules of 
    comethylated regions from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data. Regions are 
    defined from clusters of CpG sites or from genomic annotations, and then percent
    methylation values are used to identify comethylation modules. Interesting
    modules are identified and explored by comparing with sample traits and 
    examining functional enrichments. Results are then visualized with high-quality,
    editable plots from ggplot2.
