#' comethyl: An R package for weighted region comethylation network analysis
#'
#' Comethyl builds upon the \code{WGCNA} package to identify and interpret modules
#' of comethylated regions from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data. Regions
#' are defined from clusters of CpG sites or from genomic annotations, and then
#' percent methylation values are used to identify comethylation modules.
#' Interesting modules are identified and explored by comparing with sample traits
#' and examining functional enrichments. Results are then visualized with
#' high-quality, editable plots from \code{ggplot2}.
